                This was one of my (Alison) favorite visits of this trip - D House Academy. I was in 
                awe of the technology they used to create garments - polyjet printing, real-time 
                thread coloring, thermo welding, ultrasonic welding, and more. It help me understand 
                scale of invovlement technology has in fashion, and the infinite creative possibilities.

                After our visit, we went to see the Duomo as well as the infamous galleria. Both are 
                beautiful pieces of work! We also went to this calzone store that is super famous (
                had to wait in line, but it went super fast) and I was pleasently surprised by the 
                price and flavor.
