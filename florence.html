                <div class="desc">One of the best tours we've went on. Everytime I learn about the history of a luxury brand, I find myself more drawn to buying it in the future (except for Gucci, just not my vibe). The innovation of Ferragamo is really impressive, especially the experimentation with various materials -- from fishing lines to bird feathers to possin skin. Though I don't forsee myself buying a pair of shoes, I'll definitely buy one for my grandparents!</div>

                <div class="desc">Exploring the leather district and speaking to the various owners was interesting. One conversation that stood out to me was the response the owner of Infinity leather had towards his reasoning of not using vegan leather. For him, it's yet another form of greenwashing in the corporate world since it's less durable and also require another layer of plastic to keep it together. I believe this topic doesn't have a definite answer, but with advancement of technology, real statistics might be able to answer the question.</div>

                Some snipets of my Sunday -> Ran to Fiesole in the morning. It was a long hike but one of the most beautiful trails.
                I think small towns are always my favorite, I bought a piece of artwork from this cute old couple and explored the area before running back.
                Had the cutest brunch at Serre Torrigani in Piazzetta. (Well, before that, I accidentally walked 30 minutes to Serre Torrigani...)
                In the afternoon, I went the flea market and embarked on a failed search of leather bag for my dad.
                Great day :D

I find it relatable that instead of trying to quickly expand his business, they've targeted towards more artisan markets and slowly branching into expansion across Italy. I find much more satisfaction talking to people and connecting rather than trying to earn as much money as possible when it's passion.</div>
