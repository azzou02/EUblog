                After watching the BCC video on perfume and child labor (Jasmine extraction), I've developed more distrust for these big name brands. From the perfume museum tour, I learned that the base coat oil used to be from animals to help with lingering of smell. Now, they've pivoted towards synthetic plant-based or chemically derived methods. I wonder if Jasmine smell could also be replicated. However, I believe that might lead to another flawed system of job scarcity as these Jasmine pickers won't be able to have anymore income sources. All that said, perfume making was really fun! I wish we had more options of smells because I wanted to make my own floral smell.

                Fragonard musuem tour and workshop was a really interesting expereince. I had no 
                idea that the base note is what allows the perfume to stay longer on our skin, and 
                that aluminum bottle extends the longevity of the perfume to ~8 years. I was also 
                surprised to learn from the documentary how easy it is to find a loophole in the 
                system to be able to present oneself as ethical practice, when there is child labor, 
                and the different levels to processes to get a perfume to the market. Hopefully, the 
                agency checking for safe practice can do better, and the companies that have these 
                jasmine farms can pay a higher wage to the workers, so they won't have to bring 
                their children to help with income. But overall, the museum and the process of 
                making our own perfume was super fun.

Fun fact about the swimsuit was that for men it originally covered the top too because back in the 1910s, having pale skin was more fashionable. Then when sports become big, having tan skin meant "healthy" and active. The blue freeness of the dress marked a change in women's fashion. It diverges from the need for corset and thight forms.</div>

He accentuates the curves of the women body, elegance, and beauty. If I hadn't read about his life story and design thinking, I would've thought Dior was yet another scame of luxury brands. I find the different Houses and themes a really ingenious marketing concept, there's freshness and surprises that keep people anticipating. My favorite was room 2 with the flowers. I personally am drawn to the elegance and beauty that flower symbolizes.</div>

                    The Dior Museum was truly amazing. We not only were able to see Christain Dior's 
                    upbringing but also his ideals and what he wanted for women fashion. I also 
                    loved to see all the different creative directors and their unique vision for 
                    what dior is. I am especially a fan of Galliano (and his work in the Enchanted
                    Garden room). His extensive use of Chinese motifs is quite interesting to me. 
                    The "prototype" room with the perfume booth was also cool, to just engage with 
                    how the fabric draped and worked to form different shapes.
