Now, they've pivoted towards synthetic plant-based or chemically derived methods. I wonder if Jasmine smell could also be replicated. However, I believe that might lead to another flawed system of job scarcity as these Jasmine pickers won't be able to have anymore income sources. All that said, perfume making was really fun!

Fun fact about the swimsuit was that for men it originally covered the top too because back in the 1910s, having pale skin was more fashionable. Then when sports become big, having tan skin meant "healthy" and active. The blue freeness of the dress marked a change in women's fashion. It diverges from the need for corset and thight forms.</div>

He accentuates the curves of the women body, elegance, and beauty. If I hadn't read about his life story and design thinking, I would've thought Dior was yet another scame of luxury brands. I find the different Houses and themes a really ingenious marketing concept, there's freshness and surprises that keep people anticipating. My favorite was room 2 with the flowers. I personally am drawn to the elegance and beauty that flower symbolizes.</div>
