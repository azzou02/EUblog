            First days are always the longest, but seeing this dad book made me laugh really hard. It's ironic how it's close to mother's day but there a "how to be a good dad" book in bookstores.

            JetBlue has become my favorite American airline. No luggage lost, great food, good service, wide seats. What more can I ask for?

            The food options were "healthy," but oddly none of it was warmed up.

            After the long flight (and being the last group to arrive), I was surprisingly not as exhausted. I slept on every flight...no movies except finishing up the Sisterhood of Traveling Pants. The concept is actually quite cool--would it ever be possible to have fabric that caters towards you, changes accordingly to your sizes? 
            I was SO happy to be in my (Michelle) own room and enjoy this mini apartment style.

           Originally, it was suppose to be a dinner on the river but the boat crashed? Quite turnaround, we headed to a nearby restaurant.

            I got the Sole Menuiere, and it was really good!

            We walked passed the Louvre on the way back, and apparently it does light up. During Spring Break when we came at night to picnic, it didn't light up and we were quite disappointed. I sent the photo to our group chat and they were all jealous --"greedy" was their response, ahaha!
